# WATSON model comparison project

### This is the project for the model comparison between transit time distributions (TTDs) calculated by lumped parameter models (LPMs) and storAge slection (SAS) functions. 

## Introduction
This project allows computing and comparing TTDs using LPMs and SAS functions. It provides different transfer functions for the LPMs and different shapes for the SAS functions. TTDs can be computed for example data from ...
